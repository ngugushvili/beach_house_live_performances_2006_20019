# Beach House live performances  2006-2019


### WHAT

This is an interactive **shiny app** providing information about all live performances of Beach House for 2006 - 2019 years.


### WHY

Well, I love **Beach House** and I love working with numbers and data in **R**. So I thought it would be interesting to explore and visualize BH-related, publicly available data. 

### HOW

1.download data from setlist.fm

2. combine them together to create one tidy dataset 

3. download world cities data with latitudes and longitudes from [here](https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities)

4. merge it with main df 

5. create [new csv file](https://github.com/ngugushvili/beach_house_concerts) with unidentified lats and longs and merge it with main Df

6. Download [US cities dataset](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities) and add it to main df 

7. Final data cleaning

8. Create a shiny app
